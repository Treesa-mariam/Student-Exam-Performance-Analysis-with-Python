# Student-Exam-Performance-Analysis-with-Python
This project provides an in-depth analysis of student exam performance, focusing on key demographic factors. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project examines:

Gender Distribution: Visualizing the gender distribution within the dataset to understand sample representation.
Impact of Parental Education on Scores: Analyzing the influence of parental education on students' performance in math, reading, and writing, revealing a positive correlation.
Effect of Parental Marital Status: Exploring if parental marital status affects student scores, which shows minimal impact.
The findings offer insights into how socioeconomic and familial factors may contribute to academic performance, aiding in strategic interventions and educational planning.
